# Ultra Marathon Race Data Analysis with Python

## Overview

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of ultra marathon race results using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's "The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running," contains data from ultra marathon events around the world. This analysis aims to gain insights into various aspects of ultra marathon running, such as race participation, athlete demographics, and performance trends.

## Features

*   **Data Loading and Inspection:** The project utilizes Pandas to efficiently load and inspect the structure of the dataset, including data types and potential missing values.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The analysis explores the dataset to understand the data that has been imported.
*   **Libraries:** The project leverages Pandas and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used is "TWO\_CENTURIES\_OF\_UM\_RACES.csv".  It should be placed in the same directory as the notebook.  The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running)

## Usage

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Download the "TWO\_CENTURIES\_OF\_UM\_RACES.csv" dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
3.  Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:pip install pandas seaborn
4.  Open and run the `Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Pandas.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

*   **Data Cleaning:** Implement data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
*   **Advanced Analysis:** Perform more in-depth analysis, such as:
 *   Analyzing the distribution of race distances and finisher times.
 *   Investigating the relationship between athlete age/gender and performance.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Create interactive visualizations using libraries.
